Roles:
- Teacher   
- Student   
- SteamSpace Admin 

Workflow:   
- The Admin shares the installer script with the teacher.   
- The Teacher runs the script as him/herself. The script has 2 parts. At the end of part 1 the teacher has to publish the MainScript and give the key as well as his/her name to part 2 of the script. Part 2 will create the key file.(*)   
- The Teacher runs 'Test()' to set up all the permissions.   
- The Teacher puts a link to the key file out on his/her web page.
- The Student clicks on the link and opens the key file (which is an empty spreadsheet). That is sufficient to share the file to the Student. The Student then closes the file.   

(*) This manual step is obviously undesirable. I have flagged [the relevant issue](https://code.google.com/p/google-apps-script-issues/issues/detail?id=1703) with Google. When/if it gets fixed, this manual step will no longer be required.
