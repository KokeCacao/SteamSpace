<h3>Instructions For Publishing the Main Script</h3>
    <!-- These instructions are referred to by the installer script. -->
These instructions are for teachers. The steps listed here are to be executed when prompted to do so by the installer script.
You should normally only have to do this once, when you first install SteamSpace. 
<p />
We have lodged a request with Google to automate this step, so in the future hopefully the process will be easier. But for now this manual process is a necessary evil.

<p>Step 1: Go to Google Drive and find your 'SteamSpaceTeacher' folder that was created by the installer script. Open the folder (click on it).        </p>

<p>Step 4: <ol>
    <li>Type in a version name. Anything will do.</li>
    <li>Click 'Save New Version'.</li>
    <li>On the menu labelled 'Who has access to the app', select 'Anyone, even anonymous'.</li>
    <li>Click 'Deploy'.</li>
</ol></p>

    </dd>
    <dt>

    <dt>
<p>Step 5: Copy the link that is shown there. You will need it for the installer script.<br/>
(To copy on Windows, hit ctrl-A and then ctrl-C)<br/>
(To copy on Mac, hit cmd-A and then cmd-C)<br/>

    </dd>
    <dt>

<p>Step 6: Click on the function drop down and select 'PermissionThisApp'. Then click the run icon.<br/>
</p>
    </dt>

    </dd>

<p>Step 7: This is the step where you give SteamSpace the permissions it needs to store data in your drive.
Click 'Continue' and then on the next screen allow the script to have the access it requests.<br/>

That's it, you're done. Return to the installer script, paste the link where indicated and continue to part 2 of the installation script.
