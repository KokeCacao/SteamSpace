<h3>Sharing Your Key File</h3>
These instructions are for teachers.  
<p />
At this point Steam Space is set up for you to use as a teacher. Now you need to share your key file with your students.
When they have the key file you can give them assignments and automatically collect the results in your Google Drive.

<p>Step 1: Go to Google Drive and find your 'SteamSpaceTeacher' folder that was created by the installer script. Open the folder (click on it).        </p>

<p>Step 2: Find the key file. It will have a name like 'SteamSpaceKeyFile-YourName'. <b>Right-click</b> on the file and select share.</p>

    <dt>
<p>Step 3: You have 2 options, you can share via email, or you can 'get a shareable link' and put this on your web site for students to click on.</p>

    </dd>
    <dt>
<p>I chose the latter option and put link on my web site. Take a look <a href="https://sites.google.com/a/steamspace.net/robertwoodley/">here</a> for an example.</p>

That's it, you're done. See the video on SteamSpace.net for how you can use apps like SpellingBot. Email info@SteamSpace.net if you have questions.
