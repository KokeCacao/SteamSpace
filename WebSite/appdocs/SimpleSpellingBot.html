This app allows you to work on list of spelling words that your teacher has assigned. 
By default the app shows you the most recent assignment created by your teacher. You can choose other assignments by clicking
on the menu in the upper left.
<p/>
Then press the play button next to each word and then spell the word as best you can. 
When you are all done, press the 'All Done' button to see your results.
Note that everytime you press 'All Done' your results will be saved so your teacher can review them later.
<p/>
We only share your results with your teacher and with no one else. We collect no other information except your email, first name and last name.
We need your name so your teacher can identify whose results he/she is reviewing.
<p/>
You should only use the application as intended, that is to practice spelling words that your teacher has assigned.
