Spelling Bot is a sample app designed to demo the Steam Space framework. It allows for a teacher to set up
spelling lists and for 1 or more students to then take a spelling test and have the results sent back to the 
teacher's Google docs.

Steam Space allows teachers to manage assignments and class rosters in Google Docs and then to assign Chrome apps to students based on roster, with the students' results flowing back to the teacher's Google Docs in real-time.
