Steam Space allows teachers to assign Chrome Apps to students.
The teacher may give specific assignments to the students (for instance a spelling test), or may
simply ask the student to experiment with the app, to play.
In either case the app will send data about how the student used the app to the teacher (and only
to the teacher; the data does not transit via Steam Space servers - in face we don't even have servers).

<p>
There is nothing to prevent you from downloading a Steam Space app on your own and playing with it. 
Some apps, require the teachers involvement, others work fine as is.
If you get the message <b>'Running in stand-alone mode'</b>, then the
app has not detected an assignment from a teacher but is letting you use the app anyhow.
